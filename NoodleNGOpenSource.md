# Making Noodle NG an open source project #

I would like to rework all our statements, licences and   documentation files according to the guidelines mentioned in the book ["Producing Open Source Software" by Karl Fogel](http://producingoss.com/). (Actually, the book does use some kind of search engine for example ;) )

# Elements #

## Naming ##

The project is named `Noodle NG` (and not noodle, because that can lead to ambiguities with a variety of other projects) and should always be called like that. Although I don't see a big problem if we use `noodle` internally for module naming etc.

`NG` stands for Next Generation, because there existed previous versions of this project.

I took the liberty of registrating the domain [noodle-ng.org](http://noodle-ng.org) on my name so that we can have some kind of overview page there (or simply link to this Google Code page, as long we do not have anything else).

## Mission Statement ##

> Noodle NG is a web search engine for local smb/cifs network shares (Windows/Samba).

## License ##

## Features and Requirements List ##

We do have that already (but it's outdated...)

## Front page elements ##

The book mentions the following topics that should be directly visible to a web page visitor (best on the Front Page):

  * Mission Statement
  * License
  * Features and Requirements List
  * Development Status
  * Downloads
  * Version Control and Issue Tracker
  * Communication Channels

## Developer Guidlines ##

Although we're only a bunch of people, we should define some basic things there.

## Documentation ##

We all know that we need much more documentation if we want anyone else except us to use Noodle NG.
